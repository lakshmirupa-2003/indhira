<h1>Indhira Gandhi</h1>
<p>
<b>Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi[b] (née Nehru; 19 November 1917 – 31 October 1984)[2]</b> was an <b><i>Indian politician and stateswoman</b></i> who served as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi">prime minister</a> of India from <mark>1966 to 1977</mark> and <u>again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984.</u> She was <mark>India's first</mark> and, to date, <b><i>only female prime minister,</b><i> and a central figure in <b><i>Indian politics</b></i> as the leader of the <a href="https://inc.in/">Indian National Congress (INC).</a> She was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, and the mother of Rajiv Gandhi, who succeeded her in office as the country's prime minister. Gandhi's cumulative tenure of 15 years and 350 days makes her the second-longest-serving Indian prime minister after her father. Henry Kissinger described her as an "Iron Lady", a nickname that became associated with her tough personality.

During her father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru's</a> premiership from 1947 to 1964, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi">Gandhi</a> was his <mark>hostess and accompanied</mark> him on his numerous foreign trips. In 1959, she played a part in the dissolution of the communist-led <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Kerala">Kerala state government</a> as then-president of the Indian National Congress, otherwise a <mark>ceremonial position</mark> to which <u>she was elected earlier that year.</u> <i>Lal Bahadur Shastri,</i> who had succeeded Nehru as prime minister upon his death in 1964, appointed her minister of information and broadcasting in his government; the same year she was elected to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament. After Shastri's sudden death in January 1966, Gandhi defeated her rival, Morarji Desai, in the INC's parliamentary leadership election to become leader and also succeeded Shastri as prime minister
